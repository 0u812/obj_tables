- Errors/inconsistencies
  - Col F: inconsistent reaction syntax; inconsistent species ids with the `Metabolite_List` worksheet
  - Col J: inconsistent Km syntax
  - H167, H171, D229, E229, E378, E79: wrong type of content (perhaps content has mistakenly been shifted to an adjacent cell)
  - K83, K201, K430: typos
  - G55, G190: unmormalized schema allows inconsistent values of the same information in the `Regulation_List` worksheet --> confusion about which value is correct (E273, E274)    

- Compartments
  - Explicitly defined compartments

- Metabolites
  - `toct2eACP_c` is repeated
  - `Formula` heading is mispelled
  - 1 instance of `acetylco` has wrong name and formula
  - Undefined metabolites

- Reactions
  - Typos in column headings
  - Typos in regulation type enumeratios
  - Reaction ASPTA repeated
  - Inconsistent syntax for equations
  - Some reactions has missing or incomplete species compartmentalization
  - Inconsistent syntax for species compartments
  - Missing final cells in many of the kinetics tables

- Regulations
  - Imprecise metabolite regulations (acon vs acon_C; missing compartmentalization)
  - 3 repeated regulations

- Biomass coupled reactions
  - Content repeated from Reaction worksheet
